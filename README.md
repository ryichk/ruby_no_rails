## Description

## Flow

1. [Setup a Project Directory](https://www.akshaykhot.com/building-web-application-without-rails/#setup-a-project-directory) with Bundler.

2. [Install Puma Application Server](https://www.akshaykhot.com/building-web-application-without-rails/#install-puma-application-server) to listen for incoming HTTP requests.

4. [Create a Web Application](https://www.akshaykhot.com/building-web-application-without-rails/#create-a-web-application) that follows the Rack specification.

5. [Make Puma Talk to Our Application with a Rackup File](https://www.akshaykhot.com/building-web-application-without-rails/#make-puma-talk-to-our-application-with-a-rackup-file)

6. [Run the Application](https://www.akshaykhot.com/building-web-application-without-rails/#run-the-application)

7. [Use the Rack Reloader Middleware to Reload Application](https://www.akshaykhot.com/building-web-application-without-rails/#use-the-rack-reloader-middleware-to-reload-application) whenever the code changes.
